        <h1>Buzu's Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Buzu's go-to hobby for any occasion has always been listening to music. Music has always been a passion of
            his since he was a child. There are footage of him becoming hyperactive as a toddler whenever music was
            played. He'd dash to the stereo, blast the music to maximum level, and begin racing around the room dancing.
            His rage would be directed at anyone who attempted to touch the sound system. The most important thing in
            his life was music.</p>
        <p>He has this strange sensation that music is somehow tied with his fate. His girlfriends and he used to sneak
            into the garage where his brother and his band mates stored their musical equipment when he was a teenager.
            Then they'd pick guitar strings and thwack drums in an attempt to write their favorite songs. By the way, he
            can play lead.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for his brother and himself, the exercise yielded little. It wasn't just him and his brother
            who were musical; music runs in the family. On Friday nights, he recalls, they used to have song sessions
            when everyone, including his parents, took turns singing a song. They recorded the sessions and gave them to
            their neighbors for study.</p>
