            <h2>Buzu's Hobbies</h2>
         <p><span class="resort">Buzu's frequent activity that he does for fun!</span>
         
         <p>Buzu's go-to hobby for any occasion has always been listening to music. Music has always been a passion of his since he was a child. There are footage of him becoming hyperactive as a toddler whenever music was played. He'd dash to the stereo, blast the music to maximum level, and begin racing around the room dancing. His rage would be directed at anyone who attempted to touch the sound system. The most important thing in his life was music.</p>
         
         <p>He has this strange sensation that music is somehow tied with my fate. His girlfriends and he used to sneak into the garage where his brother and his band mates stored their musical equipment when he was a teenager. Then we'd pick guitar strings and thwack drums in an attempt to write our favorite songs. By the way, he can play lead.</p>
         
         <p> Unfortunately for his brother and himself, the exercise yielded little. It wasn't just him and his brother who were musical; music runs in the family. On Friday nights, he recalls, they used to have song sessions when everyone, including his parents, took turns singing a song. They recorded the sessions and gave them to our neighbors for study. </p>
