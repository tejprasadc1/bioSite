            <p> Buzu's perennial hobby, suitable for any occasion, has consistently been listening to music. His love
                for music dates back to his childhood, where there are fond memories of him becoming hyperactive as a
                toddler whenever the rhythmic tunes filled the air. In those moments, he would eagerly dash to the
                stereo, crank the music up to its maximum level, and joyously dance around the room. His possessiveness
                extended to the sound system, fiercely guarding it against anyone attempting to make adjustments. Music,
                without a doubt, held a paramount place in his life.</p>

            <p>There exists a peculiar sensation within him, suggesting that music is intricately tied to his fate.
                During his teenage years, he and his girlfriends would clandestinely sneak into the garage where his
                brother and his band stored their musical equipment. Together, they would experiment with guitar strings
                and drums, attempting to recreate their favorite songs. Notably, Buzu developed a skill for playing lead
                guitar during these musical escapades</p>

            <p> Regrettably, the creative exercise with his brother didn't yield substantial results. However, musical
                talent wasn't confined to him and his brother alone; it ran in the family. Friday nights were a special
                time, marked by memorable song sessions where everyone, including his parents, took turns singing a
                song. These sessions were documented and generously shared with their neighbors for further study,
                showcasing the family's collective passion for music. </p>
